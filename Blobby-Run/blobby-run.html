        <p class="section-content">
           <!--put in about me: My favorite thing about game development is the euphoric feeling you get when you show someone your finished project. -->
            This game was heavily inspired by my love for Geometry Dash and Subway Surfers. I wanted to combine my favorite aspects of both: 
            difficult but fair sight-reading and endless running. <br>
            <img src="BlobbyRunGif 1.0_1.gif">
            Then, I wanted to include an exciting way to collect new Blobby skins. I designed a podium animation to make the silly skins 
            have a much needed dramatic flair. Naturally, it needed confetti as well. <br>
            <img src="BlobbyRunGif 1.0_2.gif">
            Originally, after reaching a certain distance, there would be a boss fight. However, I realized that this would be jarring and 
            doesn't really fit in an endless runner setting. Eventually, I created a seperate section for the bosses, giving experienced players 
            a harder challenge for exclusive skins.
        </p>

        <h2 id="art" class="section-title"><u>Art</u></h2>
        <p class="section-content">
          As of 2025, there are 256 unique Blobby skins. Each have a running and jumping animation that were all created in Aseprite. 
          Some of them were very simple to make, while others left me scratching my head wondering how I could turn a complicated image 
          into a 16x16 pixel blobfish. <br>
          <img src="BlobbyRunGif AllSkins.gif">
          What became even more difficult were the bosses. The shark, squid, and mimic all had to be massive scary creatures while still 
          fitting in this world. The way I did this <i>(and any other complicated art)</i> was by following color and shading rules. Skip 
          to the <a href="#bosses">next section</a> to learn more about the bosses.<br>
          
        </p>

        <h2 id="bosses" class="section-title"><u>Bosses</u></h2>
         <p class="section-content">
          Some of my favorite levels in Geometry Dash were the boss levels. There was something so cool about seeing your once basic moves 
          be transformed into an acrobatic display of dodging and attacking. I wanted to imitate this in my game, so I started with the king of 
          the ocean: <b>The Shark.</b>
          <img src="BlobbyRunGif SharkFight.gif">
          I decided early on to give each of the bosses three attacks. The shark has a laser beam, a chomp attack, and a bomb blast <i>(shown above). </i>
          Each attack was built on the foundation of nearly missing the attacks. I saw playtesters literally moving their body to try and avoid 
          the Shark's chomps <i>(with little success).</i><br><br>

          When I began working on the next boss, I knew it had to be different. Rather than focusing on pinpoint precision and tight jumps, 
          I wanted to challenge the player in a <i>trippier</i> way. Enter: <b>The Squid.</b>
          <img src="BlobbyRunGif SquidFight.gif">
          The three attacks this time around was a blinding ink, a warping screen, and a reaching body. The Squid was a unique challenge 
          in design as I had to make the jumps hard enough to justify it being the second boss but easy enough to sight-read when you 
          can barely see your screen. In the end, the Squid provided a mind-bending but fair challenge that perfectly contrasted the Shark.
          <br><br>

          Despite the positive reception, I found that a lot of casual players could barely get past the Shark. Although I wanted them 
          to be challenging, I began thinking of a way to make a boss fight that is much more forgiving. That's where <b>The Mimic</b> comes in.
          <img src="BlobbyRunGif MimicFight.gif">
          The Mimic's design and chase sequence is heavily inspired by the Giant Troll fight from Castle Crashers.<br>
          I included small sections in a run that have two paths. The higher path is harder, but gives you keys that unlocks this new fight. 
          You can attempt the fight as many times as you want with 1 key, meaning failure is not as punishing. Plus, it is a much shorter challenge 
          that utilizes much floatier physics and hole-in-the wall style gameplay.
         </p>
